# image-classification
Image classifier using Tensorflow.js (a javascript library) 

A custom image classifier that you will train on the fly in the browser using TensorFlow.js, a powerful and flexible machine learning library for Javascript. 

First load and run a popular pre-trained model called MobileNet for image classification in the browser.

We will then use a technique called "transfer learning", which bootstraps our training with the pre-trained MobileNet model and customizes it to train for your application.
